# To Do List
Welcome to my to do list!!

## Overview
I created a to do list from scratch without following any tutorials. This was a challenge I set up for myself, I wanted to have more personal projects that did not come from a course or bootcamp. So here it is another project of mine!!

## Steps I took to achieve this
1. Created a wireframe
3. Created get route for index.ejs
2. Styled the ejs files
3. Added a mongoDB database to the index.js file
4. Created post routes for index.ejs
5. Did CRUD (create, read and delete, no update) on the list items that are stored in the db
6. Tested to see if everything works
7. Styled the responsiveness for tablet and laptop viewports (originally mobile responsive)
